# How can I participate?

Attendance is free for all invited participants and is open to the public, whether or not W3C members.

If you wish to express interest in attending, please fill out the [application form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSePSeO6YmmENDmTsuBD5OCY0ZkfyGKFaQ5THojWMcE0p1Q_XQ/viewform?usp=sf_link). The application form asks several questions about your background and ideas; please give these questions serious thought. In addition to the application form, you are encouraged to [submit](#how-can-i-suggest-a-presentation) a position statement and/or presentation topic. If you cannot use the application form, please answer the [application questions]({{ site.baseurl }}/application-questions/) and email your answers to [permissions-ws-2022-committee@chromium.org](mailto:permissions-ws-2022-committee@chromium.org)

Because the venue has limited space, you must receive an acceptance email to attend. You might wish to defer making non-refundable travel arrangements until you receive an invitation. Be sure to keep an eye on these important dates.

Our aim is to get diverse attendance from a variety of industries and communities, including:

- UI/UX designers and researchers;
- Privacy researchers;
- Regulators / policymakers;
- Privacy advocates; and
- Persons with expertise and/or experience related to accessibility, multilingual requirements, low connectivity environments, and the particular privacy needs of vulnerable individuals or communities

## Remote participation

This will be a hybrid workshop and we will support remote participants. Sessions will be set in Central European Time, however depending on interest we can endeavor to accommodate UTC-5 (Eastern Standard Time).


# How can I suggest a presentation?

This is a workshop, not a conference, and any presentations will be short, with topics suggested by submissions and decided by the chairs and program committee. Our goal is to actively discuss topics, not to watch presentations.

In order to best facilitate informed discussion, we encourage attendees to read the accepted topics prior to attending the workshop.

If you wish to present on a topic, you should submit a position statement by the deadline (see important dates). Our program committee will review the input provided, and select the most relevant topics and perspectives.

A good position statement should be a few paragraphs long and should include:

- Your background in the main topic areas of the workshop.
- Which topic you would like to lead discussion on.
- Links to related supporting resources.
- Any other topics you think the workshop should cover in order to be effective.
- A focus on technical issues, not process or platform preference. We plan to talk about the what, not the how.
- Position statements must be in English, preferably in HTML, markdown or plain text format. You may include multiple topics, but we ask that each person submit only a single coherent position statement. The input provided at registration time (e.g., bio, goals, interests) will be published and linked to from this workshop page.

Submissions should be between 200 and 1000 words.

Please submit statements to the program committee by adding your statement to the [position papers directory](https://github.com/w3c/permissions-ws-2022/tree/main/papers) and opening a [pull request](https://github.com/w3c/permissions-ws-2022/pulls). Alternatively, you can email your statement to the program committee at [permissions-ws-2022-committee@chromium.org](mailto:permissions-ws-2022-committee@chromium.org).
