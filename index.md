# What is the purpose of this workshop?
Existing and novel Web APIs being used in more and more contexts challenge what users can easily deal with. They may have trouble understanding which information is being disclosed to whom and the threats presented by those disclosures. Deciding when and how to seek a user’s permission or when that permission can be inferred or bypassed has been challenging, with different APIs, operating systems, and browsers handling things in different ways. Both web applications and native applications may face similar challenges in this space, therefore discussions on challenges and solutions spanning these two contexts are in scope.

The W3C Workshop on Permissions brings together security and privacy experts, UI/UX designers and researchers, browser vendors, OS developers, API authors, web publishers and users. We aim to address the privacy, security and usability challenges involved in controlling access to an increasingly powerful set of capabilities on the Web and other platforms.

# Which topics will be covered?
To keep the scope of this workshop practical, we'd like to encourage conversation about the ways in which user agents can (or cannot) engage users in its decisions about which capabilities to expose to which websites. The proposed scope includes:

- user concerns and preferences;
- better alignment of permission lifetime/duration with user tasks;
- risks and benefits of human-centric grouping/categorization of permissions and applications;
- challenges with novel capabilities;
- capability abuse threat models and mitigations;
- scoping of permissions to origins vs. applications, relation to same origin policy;
- UIs and controls;
- integrated permission control surfaces tailored to the capability itself;
- permission transparency, accountability, and control; and
- balancing well-specified permissions UX in standards with the ability for implementers to meet the future user and product requirements.


We aim to share experiences and user studies, leading to common understanding of how to ensure user comprehension and control of powerful capabilities while managing cognitive load.

The workshop will build on the [W3C Workshop on Permissions and User Consent held in 2018](https://www.w3.org/Privacy/permissions-ws-2018/cfp.html).
