# Code of Conduct

Participants in this workshop, as in all W3C activities, are expected to follow the [W3C code of ethics and professional conduct](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/) and treat each other with respect, professionalism, fairness, and sensitivity to our many differences and strengths.

Issues of inappropriate behavior may be [raised with the W3C Ombuds](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/pwe/#Procedures) (offline), with designated volunteers at the event, or with any member of the Program Committee.

# COVID Health Measures

We are committed to providing an event that is as safe as reasonably possible, and therefore require on-site attendees to comply with testing and masking rules. Even so, please be advised that a risk of exposure to COVID-19 exists in any event or public space. By attending the event in person, you acknowledge this inherent risk.

## Requirements for all in-person attendees
- **Test each day before arriving at the venue**
  - Stay home if you return a positive test. The event will be hybrid so you can attend remotely if needed.
- **Wear a valveless FFP2/N95 or equivalent (or better) mask during the event**
  - Briefly de-masking to eat or drink is ok
  - Masks must be worn while speaking
  - Masks must cover both the nose and mouth, and be well-fitted
- Current requirements to enter Germany can be found at the [German Federal Ministry of Health website](https://www.bundesgesundheitsministerium.de/en/service/gesetze-und-verordnungen/guv-19-lp/coronavirus-einreiseverordnung.html)

## All in-person attendees are strongly encouraged to
- Have completed a full course of WHO-approved vaccines, plus all recommended boosters
- Wear a mask in all indoor public spaces, including outside of the event. For meals in public venues, we recommend that attendees choose least busy, most well-ventilated establishments. This is particularly important:
  - During the 72 hours before attending the workshop
  - During your entire travel journey to Munich, Germany


## Event safety measures
- In-person attendees will be limited to 30
- FFP2/N95 masks will be provided if you forget yours
- Rapid tests are available if you need
- We will shock ventilate the rooms after every session chunk and mealtime. 
  - Bring a warm sweatshirt/jacket in case it gets a little chilly!

## Local and federal health measures
In Germany you will likely be required to wear an FFP2 (or equivalent) mask on all public transit. Note that the rules may change depending on the health situation.
